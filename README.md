# Control Flow Statements
A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes. The control flow of
a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. This section
covers the if statement and for and while loops; functions are covered later in this chapter.
Raising and handling exceptions also affects control flow
* Python supports two type of control flow statement:
1> Conditional Statement
2>Looping Statement

### 1> Conditional Statement:

Conditional statement are used to decide whether block as to execute or skip the execution 
of the block......
* If
* Else
* Elif
<pre>
* Syntax:
          if condition: statement
          
          OR
          
          if condition:
          statement1
          statement2
          .
