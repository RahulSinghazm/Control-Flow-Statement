# Control Flow Statements
A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes. The control flow of
a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. This section
covers the if statement and for and while loops; functions are covered later in this chapter.
Raising and handling exceptions also affects control flow
